## 🔗 Demonstrated Work

> Quality bar: reviewers look for **specific, verifiable work** not generic descriptions.
> A deployed contract, merged PR, or live project is ideal.

**Primary evidence link:**

<!-- ✅ Good: https://github.com/you/project — has code, commits, README -->
<!-- ❌ Bad: "I built a DeFi protocol" with no link -->

**What you built and how it demonstrates `{skill-name}`:**

<!-- Aim for 3–5 sentences. Cover: what it does, key technical decisions, outcome.  -->
<!-- ✅ Good: "Deployed a Uniswap V3 LP vault on Base Sepolia that manages USDC/ETH  -->
<!--          positions. I wrote the Solidity pair contract, integrated Chainlink price -->
<!--          feeds for rebalancing triggers, and wrote Foundry tests at 95% coverage." -->
<!-- ❌ Bad: "This proves I know {skill-name}." -->

*Do not edit this section. Filled in by maintainer during review.*

**File path check**
- [ ] File is at `skills/{category}/{skill}/{handle}/proof.md` (correct depth)

- [ ] Description is substantive (not template text, not AI-generated filler)
- [ ] Demonstrates meaningful skill depth (not a "Hello World" equivalent)

**Spam / quality gate**
- [ ] Apparent human or autonomous-agent effort — not spam or mass submission
- [ ] No duplicate proof for the same agent + skill combination
- [ ] No signs of proof fabrication (e.g. repo created same day, zero commits)
